# 📂 Dataset

**Dataset Source**

Inside Airbnb

https://insideairbnb.com/

The dataset contains:

- Listing Information
- Property Types
- Room Types
- Pricing
- Availability
- Review Scores
- Host Information
- Geographic Coordinates

---

# 🧹 Data Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Removed duplicate records
- Removed completely empty columns
- Removed listings with missing prices
- Cleaned currency values
- Converted data types
- Validated missing values
- Prepared dataset for feature engineering

Final Dataset

- Original Records : **3097**
- Clean Records : **2592**

---

# ⚙ Feature Engineering

The following engineered features were created:

- Price per Bedroom
- Occupancy Rate
- Revenue per Available Day
- Reviews per Year
- Professional Host Indicator

---

# 🗄 Database Design

DuckDB was used as the analytical database.

The following tables were created:

### Fact Table

- fact_listings

### Dimension Tables

- dim_host
- dim_location
- dim_review

A Star Schema was implemented for analytical querying.

### Star Schema

![Star Schema](dashboard/assets/star_schema.png)

---

# 📈 SQL Analytics

Several business queries were implemented, including:

- Total Listings
- Average Price
- Room Type Distribution
- Highest Revenue Listings
- Superhost Analysis
- Average Price by Neighbourhood
- Property Type Analysis
- Review Score Analysis

---

# 📊 Statistical Analysis

Four hypotheses were tested.

| Hypothesis | Result |
|------------|---------|
| H1 | ✅ Accepted |
| H2 | ✅ Accepted |
| H3 | ✅ Accepted |
| H4 | ✅ Accepted |

### H1

Entire home apartments are significantly more expensive than private rooms.

### H2

Superhosts receive significantly higher review ratings.

### H3

Listings with more reviews show statistically significant price differences.

### H4

Average prices differ significantly across neighbourhoods.

---

# 💡 Business Insights

Key findings include:

- Entire home apartments command the highest average prices.
- Superhosts consistently receive higher customer ratings.
- Premium neighbourhoods generate higher average revenue.
- Property location strongly influences pricing.
- Listings with strong customer engagement tend to perform better.
